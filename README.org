* What is this?
  This is my hand made emacs config that emulates all the parts of spacemacs I was used to. It is my current editor config and I will be slowly making additional changes/tweaks to it.

* Why is this?
  My spacemacs got really slow and I felt it was difficult for me to understand why or fix it reliably. Also updating spacemacs was always a gamble and every single time I ended up with a borked editor with subtle changes to functions I was very used to. This caused me to spend about two weeks of effort learning elisp and re-creating enough functionality of spacemacs so I could stop using spacmacs and start relying solely on my new and improved *stupid spacemacs*

* Should I use this?
  Honestly ... only if you hate yourself. There are no guarantees and the config is based entirely around my workflow.
  
  You *should* however (I think) use this to learn about how to make a lean and simple spacemacs like config.
